need a .yaml for:
- config
- task
and .py for controller thingy?

(session 4 [a bit in session 3 too] describe a lot of the .py and .yaml)

Use proxy.py to create traffic to test firewall (rather than hping3)

Edit security.py to make the firewall? (1:30hr into session4 recording)

.pcap to record traffic from wireshark, tcp replay to replay .pcap traffic
-> can find a .pcap file online of predefined traffic and use that

database indexing to reduce search time?
	filtered ip's in ranges to reduce search?
	ips 0-100, 101-200 etc.

more complex topology
check protocol aswell as IP with firewall block list
	udp
	tcp
	etc.

BLACKLIST = BLOCKLIST
WHITELIST = ALLOW LIST


Controller python path:
C:\Users\Andy\sdn-cockpit\sync\local\apps\src

Scenarios yaml path:
C:\Users\Andy\sdn-cockpit\sync\local\apps\scenarios

Tasks yaml path:
C:\Users\Andy\sdn-cockpit\sync\local\apps\tasks

Startup:

1.Open git bash from your Desktop
2.Change to the sdncockpit directory i.e.,cd sdncockpit/sdn-cockpit
3.Run the command vagrant up
4.Once this process completes(about 1 minute), run the command vagrant ssh
5.Once the VM interface appears, run the command bash run.sh

Shutdown:
1.The quit command is CTR + b followed by d. This closes the bash run.sh session
2.To shutdown the VM, exit the vm (type exit) then run vagrant halt
3.You can also check current machine states using vagrant status
